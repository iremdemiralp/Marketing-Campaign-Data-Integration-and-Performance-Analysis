SQL Analysis Projects
In this repository, I share the SQL analysis scripts I developed using DBeaver and the dashboards I created in Microsoft Power BI.

Project Overview
In this project, I focused on integrating and analyzing advertising performance data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads. My goal was to track and compare marketing metrics across platforms to support ROI-driven campaign decisions. Additionally, I aimed to identify changes and trends over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, and evaluate the efficiency of budget and conversion performance.

Key Objectives

Data Integration: I merged and standardized data from both platforms using SQL and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Performance Metrics: I collected data on spend, impressions, clicks, leads, and conversion values.

Data Cleaning: I applied transformation rules and handled nulls and inconsistencies using PostgreSQL functions.

Cross-Platform Analysis: I enabled direct comparisons of performance and campaigns across ad platforms.

Reporting: I prepared the dataset to be easily visualized in Microsoft Power BI, facilitating stakeholder review and informed decision-making.

Purpose of the Project
With this project, I aimed to demonstrate my skills in SQL, Power BI, and data analysis by effectively solving real-world data problems.
