## SQL Analysis Projects 

This repository contains SQL analysis scripts created using DBeaver. Each file includes queries tailored to specific business needs or data analysis scenarios.

### Project Overview
This project focuses on integrating and analyzing advertising performance data from Facebook Ads and Google Ads. The main goal is to track and compare cross-platform marketing metrics to support ROI-driven campaign decisions. Additionally, the analysis aims to uncover year-over-year changes, trends, and evaluate the efficiency of budget and conversion performance across platforms.

### Key Objectives
Data Integration: Merged and standardized data from both platforms using SQL and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Performance Metrics: Collected daily-level data on spend, impressions, clicks, leads, and conversion value.

Data Cleaning: Applied transformation rules and handled nulls and anomalies using PostgreSQL functions.

Cross-Platform Analysis: Enabled direct performance comparisons across ad platforms.

Reporting: Prepared the dataset for visualization in Tableau for stakeholder reporting and decision-making.
